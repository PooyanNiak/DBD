Attention in driving is a key factor in safe transportation. According to the CDC
motor vehicle safety division, one in five car accidents is caused by a distracted driver1
.
Sadly, this translates to 425,000 people injured and 3,000 people killed by distracted
driving every year. Our aim in this project is to develop a system that can detect
driver behavior based on the input video from the dashcam and alarm the user if the
driver is not following the traffic rules or if the driversâ€™ eyes are not on the road.
